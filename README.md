# img_to_ascii2
Print out any* image you want in your terminal

*Currently you must go to the executable's path to access `palettes.txt`, oops... I'll fix that a bit later*
Usage: `img_to_ascii2.exe <image> <columns> <rows> [<palette>]`

There are a couple of predefined palettes, although, you may also make your own palettes in the file named: `palettes.txt`.

I have since thought of a couple of ideas for improvement.
